Neohabitat is a relaunch of the first massively multiplayer online roleplaying game, Lucasfilm's Habitat. Neohabitat is an open-source project led by Randy Farmer, one of Habitat's creators, reviving the original Habitat world.

We maintain a demo server running the latest NeoHabitat code and you can connect to it at any time. There's often a few members of the regular crew hanging out there, so come say hey!

Here's how to get inworld:

When you've completed running this installer, double click on the Desktop icon and wait until you reach the blue title screen. Press Enter to continue.

Type in the avatar name you wish to use and press Enter.

Once you see the Habitat title screen, press Alt + N and Enter and you will load into the world. It takes a little while, so sit back and relax!
